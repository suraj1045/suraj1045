## 🏗️ Core Engineering Philosophy  

Beyond just building tools, I am deeply curious about the **"Why"** and **"How"** of software. My work is guided by:

* **Pattern-Driven Development:** Active application of Creational, Structural, and Behavioral Design Patterns to build maintainable systems.
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** A strong interest in Algorithm Design, focusing on optimizing time/space complexity and data structure selection.
* **Architectural Integrity:** Implementing **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **SOLID principles** to ensure codebases remain scalable and decoupled.
* **Mathematical Foundations:** Exploring the concepts of Convex Optimization, Statistics, and ML architectures.
